## How to migrate from wiki to Github Pages

1. Create/prepare a repository: Under https://github.com/OpenChain-Project , create/prepare your repository. In this example, "OpenChain-JWG" is used.  
   
1. Create "docs" folder: After preparing "OpenChain-Project/OpenChain-JWG" repository, create "docs" folder.

   1. In Settings->Github Pages, change **```Source```** to **```master branch/docs folder```**.  
   ![source](images/docs.png)  
   After applying this settings, you can see the Website(GithubPages) at **```https://OpenChain-Project.github.io/[repository-name]/```**  
   1. If you want, you can change theme of the page.  **```Change theme```** . In this example, [Cayman](https://pages-themes.github.io/cayman/) is used. 
   The config looks like [docs/_config.yml](https://github.com/NorioKobota/OpenChain-JWG/blob/master/docs/_config.yml) Other settings can be referred  in [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages-and-jekyll), and Jekyll

1. Create contents of your Website in the "docs" folder. index.md, etc.  
Note: GitHub Pages has a folder size limit of 1GB.[Guidelines for using GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#guidelines-for-using-github-pages)
   ```GitHub Page's source repositories have a recommended limit of 1GB.```
  Note: It is recommended to place text-only files in the "docs" folder, and large size files like images should be placed in other folders.  
Note: It is easy and useful to use Emoji instead of an image file.[Emoji](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html)ã€‚ In **```Code```** , if the text code is ```U+1F600```, then you can display by writing ```&#x1F600;```.  
Note: We're not sure but storing many photos are not allowed in GitHub.
